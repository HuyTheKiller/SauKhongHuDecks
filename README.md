### Forgotten Decks are here!
Harder counterparts of Deadly Sins and Heavenly Virtues are finally here!

They use the modified mechanic of [Tattered Decks](https://github.com/survovoaneend/Tattered-Decks) - a button to switch between the decks and their counterparts.
To enable the full experience, make sure [Galdur](https://github.com/Eremel/Galdur) is installed.

[Galdur](https://github.com/Eremel/Galdur) is not installed? Or do you simply not like the Forgotten button?

Worry not, you can go to Mods > SauKhongHu Decks > Config and enable "Disable Deck Override" to load the decks normally.

### Talisman compatibility
This mod should now function properly with or without [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman). Feel free to experience stuff along side with [Cryptid](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Cryptid).

### Multiplayer compatibility
If [Balatro Multiplayer](https://github.com/Balatro-Multiplayer/BalatroMultiplayer) is installed:
* Several decks will be hidden from selection.
* [Tattered Decks](https://github.com/survovoaneend/Tattered-Decks)-style button will be hidden, all supported Forgotten Decks will be exposed without the need of "Disable Deck Override".

Currently, Multiplayer-supported decks include:
* Deadly Sin Decks (plus Wormy Chaos)
* Forgotten Sin Decks
* Heavenly Virtue Decks (plus Omnipotent Worm)
